***** Abstract *****
The Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI) and the Human Proteome Organisation
(HUPO) Proteomics Standards Initiative (PSI) define community standards for
data representation in proteomics/metabolomics to facilitate data comparison,
exchange and verification. In this context, the two organizations are working
together on a shared standard for downstream results, following mass
spectrometry (MS) analysis. This document defines a tab-delimited text file
format to report metabolomics results, based on a shared core mzTab format,
which was primarily used in the proteomics context before (mzTab v 1.0).
The intention of this specification, mzTab for Metabolomics (mzTab-M), is to
extend the concepts established in the previous specification, so that more
detail can be captured about the evidence trail for quantification, including
MS features (different charge states or adducts) and the evidence trail for
identifications, specifically for MS-based experiments on small molecules
(metabolites, lipids, contaminants, etc.). mzTab-M is not formally backwards
compatible, but follows a similar design pattern to simplify adaptation of
existing software and to facilitate its integration into bioinformatics
processing and submission workflows.
***** 1. Introduction *****
**** 1.1. Background ****
This document addresses the systematic description of small molecule
identification and quantification data retrieved from mass spectrometry (MS)-
based experiments. A large number of software tools are available that analyze
MS data and produce a variety of different output data formats.
mzTab-M is intended as a reporting standard for quantitative results from
metabolomics/lipodomics approaches. This format is further intended to provide
local LIMS systems as well as MS metabolomics repositories a simple way to
share and combine basic information.
mzTab has been developed with a view to support the following general tasks
(more specific use cases are provided in [use-cases-for-mztab]):
   1. Facilitate the sharing of final experimental results, especially with
      researchers outside the field of metabolomics.
   2. Export of results to external software, including programs such as
      Microsoft ExcelÂ® and Open Office Spreadsheet and statistical software /
      coding languages such as R.
   3. Act as an output format of (web-) services that report MS-based results
      and thus can produce standardized result pages.
   4. Be able to link to the external experimental evidence e.g. by referencing
      back to mzML files.
This document presents a specification, not a tutorial. As such, the
presentation of technical details is deliberately direct. The role of the text
is to describe the model and justify design decisions made. The document does
not discuss how the models should be used in practice, consider tool support
for data capture or storage, or provide comprehensive examples of the models in
use. It is anticipated that tutorial material will be developed independently
of this specification.
**** 1.2. Document Structure ****
The remainder of this document is structured as follows.
[use-cases-for-mztab] lists requirements that mzTab-M is designed to support.
[notational-conventions] describes the terminology used.
[relationship-to-other-specifications] describes how the specification
presented in [format-specification] relates to other specifications, both those
that it extends and those that it is intended to complement.

1. Introduction
**** 2.1. 1.1 Background ****
A large number of proteomics search engines are available, each outputting
results in a variety of file formats. mzIdentML [1] is a HUPO-PSI endorsed
community standard that provides a common file format for identification
results. This extension document has been released in parallel with mzIdentML
version 1.3. mzIdentML version 1.3 supports extensions for additional features
or use cases which can be described in additional documents, rather than
editing the original specification document.
This mzIdentML 1.3.0 extension document provides further information on the
encoding of crosslinking Mass Spectrometry (MS) results in mzIdentML. It has
two aims:
1- Extend the crosslinking use cases supported by mzIdentML version 1.2.0
(2017) to cover what is currently required by the state-of-the-art in the
field. Particular attention is paid to workflows using cleavable crosslinkers.
2- Provide further clarification and documentation on how to encode
crosslinking data in an mzIdentML file.
**** 2.2. 1.2. Supported Crosslinking Use Cases ****
Already supported use case in mzIdentML 1.2.0:
    * Two crosslinked peptides (the crosslinking product that is typically of
      most interest).
New use cases supported in this extension (part of mzIdentML 1.3.0):
1- Reporting cleavable crosslinkers. MS-cleavable crosslinkers can cleave upon
activation in the mass spectrometer, releasing the individual peptides and thus
enabling their individual analysis. Section 7.11 of the main mzIdentML 1.3.0
specification gives a new mechanism for encoding identifications based on
multiple spectra, using this is essential for some cleavable crosslinker
workflows. Such a workflow is used as an example in Section 7.11 of the main
specification document.
2- Internally linked peptides (commonly known as âlooplinksâ). Internally
linked peptides are cases where both ends of the crosslinker are within a
single peptide, not between two copies of the same peptide. This type of
crosslinking product is therefore necessarily intramolecular.
3- Noncovalently associated peptides. Some spectra may show the fragmentation
of two different peptides which were not crosslinked but stayed associated due
to noncovalent interactions [2]. Both peptides together appear as a single
precursor species in the instrument, as opposed to âchimericâ spectra where
a single peptide is selected as precursor but additional peptide(s) fall within
the same selection window. Identifying these noncovalently associated peptides
may improve the accuracy of the results as it can prevent them from being
misidentified as crosslinked peptides.
4- Additionally, the encoding of scores applicable to crosslinking MS results,
and their corresponding thresholds, has been clarified and improved.
An overview of the different crosslinking product types and their support in
mzIdentML is given in Figure 1. For discussion of the product types that are
not supported in this version of mzIdentML (crosslinkers with more than two
reactive groups, higher order crosslinked peptides) see Â§5.

**** 2.4. 1.3 Document Structure and Changes from mzIdentML Version 1.2.0 to
1.3.0 to Support Crosslinking Results ****
mzIdentML version 1.3.0 makes two significant changes: (i) a new mechanism for
encoding identifications based on multiple spectra, including the retiral of
the old method for doing this; (ii) the ability to supplement the specification
with extension documents covering specific use cases. The general guidance on
the mzIdentML file format given in the main specification document all applies
here, with this extension document giving guidance on the use of the controlled
vocabulary (CV) terms specific to crosslinking.
The previously supported crosslinking use case was described in the main
mzIdentML 1.2.0 specification document. In mzIdentML 1.3.0 this information has
been moved to this extension document but it remains unchanged. The only change
to the previous version 1.2.0 support for crosslinking is regarding
identifications based on multiple spectra, this change is covered in Section
7.11 of the main mzIdentML 1.3.0 specification document.
The new use cases supported in this extension (version 1.0.0, compatible with
mzIdentML version 1.3.0) are explained in detail in the following Sections of
this document (denoted with an Â§). All of them have new controlled vocabulary
terms associated with them.
Section 3 of this extension document is organised on the basis of elements in
the mzIdentML schema, see Figure 2. For each of the new use cases, the list
below states the relevant sections of this document and the new CV terms.
1- Reporting cleavable crosslinkers. See Â§3.2.2. Three new CV terms have been
created related to encoding the derivatives of cleavable crosslinkers:
    *      âcleavable crosslinker stubâ (MS:1003346),
    *      âUnimod derivative codeâ (MS:1003347),
    *      âcrosslinker cleavage characteristicsâ (MS:1003390).
2- Internally linked peptides (a.k.a. âlooplinksâ). See Sections Â§3.3 &
Â§3.4.3. One new CV term has been created to allow the encoding:
    *      âlooplink spectrum identification itemâ (MS:1003329).
3- Noncovalently associated peptides. See Â§3.2.1 and Â§3.4.2. Two new CV terms
have been created related to noncovalently associated peptides:
    *      ânoncovalently associated peptides searchâ (MS:1003330),
    *      ânoncovalently associated peptides spectrum identification
           itemâ (MS:1003331).
4- Improvements in the encoding of scores and thresholds related to
crosslinking results. See Section Â§4. Seven CV terms have been created:
    *      "crosslinked PSM-level global FDR" (MS:1003337),
    *      âpeptide-pair sequence-level global FDRâ (MS:1003338),
    *      âpeptide-pair passes thresholdâ (MS:1003339),
    *      âresidue-pair passes thresholdâ (MS:1003340),
    *      âprotein-protein interaction passes thresholdâ (MS:
           1003341),
    *      âregular expression for whether interaction score derived
           from crosslinking passes thresholdâ (MS:1003342),
    *      âFDR applied separately to self crosslinks and protein
           heteromeric crosslinksâ (MS:1003343),
    *      âresidue pair refâ (MS:1003344).
    *      âregular expression for residue-pair refâ (MS:1003345)
**** 2.5. 1.4 Availability of Documentation and Example Files ****

***** 3. + *****
***** 4. 2. Controlled Vocabularies for Encoding Crosslinks *****
A collection of terms for describing a certain domain is called a controlled
vocabulary (CV) [3]. Section 4.1 of the main mzIdentML 1.3.0 document describes
the use of CVs in mzIdentML. The PSI-MS CV (https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/psi-ms-
CV) can be used to encode many types of technical information in mzIdentML
(e.g. statistical scores, mass spectrometers, etc). There are two other CVs
that are relevant to encoding crosslinking data in mzIdentML: Unimod and XLMOD.
XLMOD (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HUPO-PSI/mzIdentML/master/cv/
XLMOD.obo)_[.underline# ] represents the crosslinker reagents. Unimod
[.underline(http://www.unimod.org/obo/unimod.obo)# [.underline]# #] represents
the resulting modifications in the crosslinked peptides/proteins.
At the time of writing (Unimod v2.1, XLMOD v1.1.12) both CVs have advantages
and disadvantages when used for encoding crosslinking results in mzIdentML. For
example, the representation of heterobifunctional crosslinkers (crosslinkers
with different reactive groups) is better in XLMOD. However, the representation
of the derivatives from a cleavable crosslinker is more complete in Unimod.
Which CV (XLMOD or Unimod) to use for encoding crosslinker modifications is
left as the implementersâ choice.
There is also some overlap between the information stored in these CVs and the
contents of the <SearchModification> elements in mzIdentML. The
<SearchModification> elements can encode: the derivatives of cleavable
crosslinkers, namely the crosslinker stub as a peptide modification on the MS3
level and crosslinker cleavability as stub fragments on the MS2 level; and
crosslinker specificity (including heterobifunctional crosslinkers).
Implementers SHOULD describe the crosslinker modifications searched for as
<SearchModification> elements; this provides a consistent way of retrieving
crosslinker modification information regardless of which CV has been used, see
Â§3.2.2.
***** 5. 3. Encoding the Results of Crosslinking Searches *****
**** 5.1. 3.1. Introduction ****
mzIdentML documents MUST indicate that they are implementing the guidance in
this extension document by including the following CV term inside the top-level
<MzIdentML> element, immediately after the <cvList> element:
<cvParam cvRef="PSI-MS" accession="MS:1003385" name="mzIdentML crosslinking
extension document version"
value="1.0.0"/>
Crosslinked peptides presented a challenge for mzIdentML 1.2.0, since more than
one peptide can be identified from the same spectrum.
mzIdentML 1.2.0 solved this by:
    *      introducing the âcrosslink donorâ (MS:1002509) and
           âcrosslink acceptorâ (MS:1002510) CV terms â the values
           of these terms associate either <SearchModification> elements
           (see Â§3.2.2) or <Modification> elements (see Â§3.3);
    *      introducing the âcrosslink spectrum identification itemâ
           (MS:1002511) CV term â the values of these terms group
           <SpectrumIdentificationItem> elements within a
           <SpectrumIdentificationResult> (see Â§3.4).
Note that âcrosslink donorâ (MS:1002509) and âcrosslink acceptorâ (MS:
1002510) are used in two different contexts:
    *      /MzIdentML/AnalysisProtocolCollection/
           SpectrumIdentificationProtocol/ ModificationParams/
           SearchModification â encoding the modifications searched for
           (including the specificity, see Â§3.2.2);
    *      /MzIdentML/SequenceCollection/Peptide/Modification - encoding
           the actual modifications present in the crosslinked peptides
           (Â§3.3).
The rules that govern their use differ in each context, the details of these
rules are given in Â§3.2.2 & Â§3.3. To emphasise that they differ, Appendix I
compares them. Appendix I presents no new information on how to encode
crosslinking results in mzIdentML.
Figure 2 gives an overview of how the subsections here (Â§3) relate to the
elements in an mzIdentML file.

Figure 2. Overview of the mzIdentML 1.3.0. Format (crosslinking extension).
Elements are labelled with the section from this document that contains
guidance on how to encode them.
**** 5.2. 3.2 <SpectrumIdentificationProtocol> Elements ****
A <SpectrumIdentificationProtocol> element describes the parameters and
settings of a spectrum identification analysis. There may be several of these
protocols included in one mzIdentML file. In the case of analysis workflows in
which an identification is based on multiple spectra (see Section 7.11 of the
main mzIdentML 1.3.0 specification document), these spectra identifications may
be included in different <SpectrumIdentificationList> elements, each associated
with a different <SpectrumIdentificationProtocol>.
Section 2 of the main mzIdentML 1.3.0 specification document states that âall
search parameters should be described in sufficient detail to enable a user to
run the same or a similar search on the same or another search engineâ. As
far as possible, the information that would be needed to reannotate the mass
spectra SHOULD be included. The <FragmentTolerance> and <ParentTolerance>
subelements of <SpectrumIdentificationProtocol> SHOULD be completed.
Two child elements of <SpectrumIdentificationProtocol> are covered in more
detail here:
    *      <AdditionalSearchParams> (Â§3.2.1),
    *      <ModificationParams> (Â§3.2.2).
*** 5.2.1. 3.2.1 Additional Search Parameters ***
Path: /MzIdentML/AnalysisProtocolCollection/SpectrumIdentificationProtocol/
AdditionalSearchParams
If a crosslinking search has been performed then the CV term âcrosslinking
searchâ (MS:1002494) MUST be present within the <AdditionalSearchParams>
subelement of every <SpectrumIdentificationProtocol> associated with that
search (see Figure 3).
The ion series that were searched for SHOULD also be included here.
New supported use case in this extension - noncovalently associated peptides:
mzIdentML 1.2.1 introduces a new CV term â ânoncovalently associated
peptides searchâ (MS:1003330). If pairs of noncovalently associated peptides
were also searched for, then the <SpectrumIdentificationProtocol> elements MUST
also contain this new CV term within their <AdditionalSearchParams> subelement,
see Figure 3.
The new CV term "FDR applied separately to self crosslinks and protein
heteromeric crosslinks" (MS:1003343), see Â§4.4, which SHOULD be present is
also shown in Figure 3.

ModificationParams/SearchModification
The <SpectrumIdentificationProtocol> element encodes the modifications that
were searched for within its <ModificationParams> subelement. These are encoded
in <SearchModification> elements within <ModificationParams>.
mzIdentML version 1.3.0 introduces two new CV terms to link
<SearchModification> elements and <Modification> elements - âsearch
modification idâ (MS:1003392) which goes inside <SearchModification>
elements, and âsearch modification id refâ (MS:1003393) which goes inside
<Modification> elements. Making this link is optional but recommended where
possible. In the case of open modification searches, such a link cannot be
made. See Section 7.12 of the main mzIdentML specification document.
Each crosslinker reagent is defined by multiple <SearchModification> elements
that contain either the âcrosslink donorâ (MS:1002509) or âcrosslink
acceptorâ (MS:1002510) CV term. An example is given in Figure 4(i). The
residue specificities of the crosslinkers used SHOULD be encoded here, examples
are given in Appendix II.
The value slot of the crosslink donor and acceptor CV terms is interpreted as a
local identifier for the <SearchModification> elements describing a single
reagent. The rules governing the use of the crosslink donor and acceptor CV
terms in <SearchModification> elements are given in Figure 4(ii).
There may be more than two <SearchModification> elements required. For example,
if the crosslinker reacts with the sidechains and also with the protein
termini, see Appendix II for examples.
<SearchModification> elements can contain one or more children of the CV term
âpeptide modification detailsâ (MS:1001471). These CV terms can encode
information on neutral losses, see Figure 4(i).
New supported use case in this extension - cleavable crosslinkers: mzIdentML
1.3.0 adds three new CV terms relating to modifications from cleavable
crosslinkers â âcleavable crosslinker stubâ (MS:1003346), âUnimod
derivative codeâ (MS:1003347) and âcrosslinker cleavage characteristicsâ
(MS:1003390).
At the MS3 level, where single peptides and part of the cleaved crosslinker are
identified, the crosslinker modifications SHOULD include the CV term
âcleavable crosslinker stubâ (MS:1003346).
The crosslink stub modification MUST also have a suitably sourced CV term for
the reagent (see Appendix II). Additionally, if Unimod is being used as the CV,
then the CV term âUnimod derivative codeâ (MS:1003347) MAY be used to state
which derivative of the cleaved crosslinker is identified. The single-letter
derivative codes in Unimod are chosen arbitrarily when a linker definition is
added to Unimod. For instance, in https://unimod.org/xlink.html one can find
the examples "A for alkene, S for sulfenic acid, and T for thiol", and e.g.
Xlink:DSS uses W for loss of water. There is no formal vocabulary for the
single-letter codes. "UNIMOD derivative code" must be equal to one of the
derivative codes defined in the corresponding Unimod entry (not a random
character unrelated to the definition). An example Unimod entry is at https://
www.unimod.org/modifications_view.php?editid1=1842_.
At the MS2 level, the new CV term âcrosslinker cleavage characteristicsâ
(MS:1003390) signifies that the crosslinker is cleavable and on cleavage can
leave a given stub. This can lead to additional stub fragments in the MS2
spectra that contain the crosslinker stub instead of the whole crosslinker plus
the second peptide. Each âcrosslinker cleavage characteristicsâ CV term
represents one possible crosslinker stub. It has a structured value -
name:_mass_:_pairs with_
Name must be a single character to identify this stub. The scope of name is
restricted to that crosslinker definition, i.e. they need only be unique within
that crosslinker definition not the whole file or the <SpectrumIdentification>
element. Mass gives the monoisotopic mass delta of the resulting stub in
Daltons. Pairs with MUST be a sequence of one or more characters, giving the
name(s) of the partner stub(s). See Appendix II for examples.
Note that the choice of which <SearchModification> is the donor and which one
is the acceptor is arbitrary.

**** 5.3. 3.3 Encoding Crosslinked Peptides in the Element <SequenceCollection>
****
Path: /MzIdentML/SequenceCollection
The peptides that have been identified are encoded in the <SequenceCollection>
element. This will include both crosslinked and uncrosslinked peptides.
A word of warning about redundancy, it is not the intention of mzIdentML that
every <SpectrumIdentificationItem> (Â§3.4) references a new <Peptide> in
<SequenceCollection> â âthe combination of <Peptide> sequence and
modifications MUST be unique in the fileâ (main mzIdentML specification
document, Section 6.68). However, each distinct combination of crosslinked
peptides will require a new pair of <Peptide> elements in <SequenceCollection>.
To represent the crosslinked peptides, mzIdentML 1.2.0 added a mechanism for
linking two different <Peptide> elements together, using the CV terms
âcrosslink donorâ (MS:1002509) and âcrosslink acceptorâ (MS:1002510).
An identical value for these terms indicates that they are grouped together,
see Figure 5(i).
The rules governing the use of the crosslink donor and acceptor CV terms in
<Modification> elements are given in Figure 5(ii).
As of mzIdentML 1.3.0, <Modification> elements MAY contain the CV term "search
modification id ref" (MS:1003393) to link a <Modification> to a
<SearchModification> element. The value of this term is the unique id of the
<SearchModification> as defined by its "search modification id" (MS:1003392) CV
term. It is recommended to use this approach for the encoding of modifications
from crosslinkers, see Appendix II.
New supported use case in this extension - internally linked peptide: An
internally linked peptide has both ends of the crosslinker within it. To encode
an internally crosslinked peptide the <Peptide> can contain one <Modification>
element with the âcrosslink donorâ CV term and one <Modification> element
with the âcrosslink acceptorâ CV term. The same rules apply to these CV
terms when encoding internally linked peptides as when encoding crosslinked
peptides (Figure 5 (ii)). For an example of how to encode an internally linked
peptide, see Figure 5(iii).
The accompanying example file multiple_spectra_per_id_1.3.0_draft.mzid
illustrates a common cleavable crosslinker workflow [4].
Child CV terms of âpeptide modification detailsâ (MS:1001471) can be
included in <Modification> elements to provide additional information about the
modification, including the new cleavable crosslinker related CV terms, see
Â§3.2.2. This is not recommended if the <Modification> elements have "search
modification id ref" (MS:1003393) CV terms to link them to a
<SearchModification> element, as it would add unnecessary duplication to the
file.
The encoding for crosslinked peptides MAY be combined with the encoding for
modification localisation scoring, using the same mechanism (main mzIdentML
1.3.0 document, Section 5.2.8).

(ii) If a pair of crosslinked peptides has been identified:
    *      One peptideâs <Modification> element MUST be flagged as
           âcrosslink donorâ and one MUST be flagged as âcrosslink
           acceptorâ.
    *      A unique identifier linking exactly two <Modification> elements
           together MUST be in the value slot. (Thereby excluding the
           representation of trimeric crosslinkers, see Â§6.)
    *      If the CV term âsearch modification id refâ (MS:1003393) is
           being used then the crosslink donor MUST be chosen to match the
           end marked as the donor in the corresponding
           <SearchModification> elements, see Â§3.2.2. If that CV term is
           not used, or if the preceding rule does not unambiguously
           define which end to mark as donor (e.g. because the crosslinker
           is symmetrical) then the export software SHOULD use the
           following rules to choose the crosslink donor as the: longer
           peptide, then higher peptide neutral mass, then alphabetical
           order.
    *      The crosslink donor <Modification> element MUST have the
           attribute monoisotopicMassDelta = the mass gain from the
           crosslink reagent.
    *      The crosslink acceptor peptideâs <Modification> element MUST
           have monoisotopicMassDelta = 0.
    *      The crosslink donor peptideâs <Modification> element MUST
           have a suitably sourced cvParam for the crosslink. The
           crosslink acceptor peptideâs <Modification> element MUST NOT
           have a cvParam for the reagent.

As indicated above, to use the ânoncovalently associated peptides spectrum
identification itemâ (MS:1003331), the element <AdditionalSearchParams> MUST
contain the CV term ânoncovalently associated peptides searchâ (MS:
1003330), see Figure 3.
The rules governing the use of the ânoncovalently associated peptides
spectrum identification itemâ CV term are given in Figure 8 (ii) and are
analogous to those governing the use of âcrosslink spectrum identification
itemâ. The peptides referred to will be linear, uncrosslinked peptides.

**** 5.5. + ****
***** 6. 4. Scores and Thresholds *****
**** 6.1. 4.1 Introduction ****
This section addresses the encoding of error control procedures. This consists
of encoding scores (Â§4.3) and the corresponding thresholds (Â§4.2) applied to
those scores. The contents of this section are all optional; at the PSM level,
providing threshold information and identifications that fall below the given
significance threshold is encouraged.
âDepending on the intended purpose of the file, the file producer MAY wish to
report a number of identifications that fall below the given significance
threshold, for example to allow global statistical analyses to be performed
which are not possible if only identifications passing the threshold are
reported.â (Section 7.4 of the main mzIdentML 1.3.0 specification document)
mzIdentML also provides the option not to encode the peptide spectrum matches
that fell below the threshold applied. (Â§4.2)
The correspondence between scores and the applied thresholds is indicated by
using the same CV term for both. That is, the same CV term will be used within
the <Threshold> element and within either the related
<SpectrumIdentificationItem> element or the related
<ProteinDetectionHypothesis> element.
One specific type of score is an FDR (False Discovery Rate) score. Comments
specific to FDR are in Â§4.4.
There are different points in the analysis at which thresholds may be applied
[5] [6]. These correspond to different levels of consolidation at which
analyses may be performed. Scores and thresholds are encoded differently in
mzIdentML depending on the level of consolidation at which they were applied.
For crosslinking studies encoded in mzIdentML, the possible levels are:
    *      crosslink containing PSM (also known as Crosslink Spectrum
           Match, CSM), see Â§4.3.1,
    *      unique peptide-pair, see Â§4.3.2,
    *      unique residue-pair, see Â§4.3.3,
    *      protein-protein interaction (PPI) see Â§4.3.3.
Unique residue-pair and protein-protein interaction level scores are described
in the same section as they are encoded using the same mechanism.
The example file scores_and_thresholds_1_3_0_draft.mzid gives a simplified
example containing two crosslinks and shows scores and thresholds applied at
all four levels. Figures 10, 11, 14 and 15 are XML-snippets from that example
file.
mzIdentML allows peptide-level scores to be associated with âunique
peptidesâ (not arbitrary groups of peptides). There are three mutually
exclusive definitions of âunique peptideâ:
    *      âgroup PSMs by sequenceâ (MS:1002496);
    *      âgroup PSMs by sequence with modificationsâ (MS:1002497);
    *      âgroup PSMs by sequence with modifications and chargeâ (MS:
           1002498).
If peptide level (re)scoring is used, exactly one of these CV terms must be
placed in the <AdditionalSearchParams> element to state the definition of
âunique peptideâ in use (see Section 5.2.7 of the main specification
document). As these are mutually exclusive, an error control procedure which
uses more than one definition of âunique peptideâ cannot be fully captured
by mzIdentML.
**** 6.2. 4.2 Thresholds ****
Section 7.4 of the main mzIdentML specification document gives general guidance
on the encoding of thresholds and what has passed them. Note that thresholds
are encoded in two different places: in the <SpectrumIdentificationProtocol>
element and in the <ProteinDetectionProtocol> element. In both cases, they are
encoded using CV terms inside a <Threshold> element, see Figure 10.
The <Threshold> element inside <SpectrumIdentificationProtocol> gives the
thresholds associated with <SpectrumIdentificationItem> elements. These
thresholds apply at the crosslinked PSM level and at a unique peptide level.
Analogously, the <Threshold> element inside <ProteinDetectionProtocol> includes
the thresholds associated with <ProteinDetectionHypothesis> elements. These
thresholds apply at the unique residue-pair level and PPI level.
The elements <SpectrumIdentificationItem> and <ProteinDetectionHypothesis> have
a mandatory Boolean attribute passThreshold that allows a file producer to
indicate that an identification has passed the given thresholds or that it has
been manually validated.
The passThreshold attribute of <SpectrumIdentificationItem> relates only to the
passing of PSM-level thresholds (see Section 5.2.7 of the main specification
document, final paragraph therein).
To enable additional thresholding at the peptide-pair level in the context of
crosslinking, a new CV term is required for all PSMs (âpeptide-pair passes
thresholdâ, MS:1003339) as shown in Figure 11. This is similar to the general
guidance on peptide level thresholds given in Section 5.2.7 of the main
specification document.
The passThreshold attribute of <ProteinDetectionHypothesis> only relates to the
presence or absence of proteins, it is not directly related to the
identification of crosslinks. Whether or not residue-pairs or PPIs have passed
significance thresholds is encoded by including the new CV terms âresidue-
pair passes thresholdâ (MS:1003340) or âprotein-protein interaction passes
thresholdâ (MS:1003341) in the <ProteinDetectionHypothesis> element. The
values of these CV terms include an identifier that associates them with a
specific residue pair or PPI, see Figure 14.
At each level of consolidation there may be multiple scores. Therefore, for
each level there is a mechanism for encoding whether the identification passed
when all scores are considered:
    *      for PSM-level identifications this is the passThreshold
           attribute of <SpectrumIdentificiationItem>;
    *      at peptide-pair level it is the âpeptide-pair passes
           thresholdâ (MS:1003339) CV term;
    *      at residue-pair level it is the âresidue-pair passes
           thresholdâ (MS:1003340) CV term;
    *      and for PPIs it is the âprotein-pair passes thresholdâ (MS:
           1003341) CV term.
If the file producer does not want to indicate that thresholds have been set,
all identification elements (<SpectrumIdentificationItem> and
<ProteinDetectionHypothesis>) MUST have the attribute passThreshold = âtrue"
and the âno threshold" CV term should be provided within the
<SpectrumIdentificationProtocol> and <ProteinDetectionProtocol> (Section 7.4 of
the main mzIdentML 1.3.0 specification document). In this case, the new
âresidue-pair passes threshold" (MS:1003340) and âprotein-protein
interaction passes threshold" (MS:1003341) CV terms can be omitted.

Figure 10. XML snippet showing the thresholds applied at all four levels of
consolidation. These are - PSM, peptide-pair, residue pair and PPI. The CV
terms MS:1002490 and MS:1002496 are required to enable peptide level rescoring
(mzIdentML main specification Section 5.2.7) and to state the definition of
âunique peptideâ being used.
**** 6.3. + ****
**** 6.4. 4.3 Scores ****
*** 6.4.1. 4.3.1 Match Level Scores ***
Match level scores are stored in <SpectrumIdentificationItem> elements.
The CV mapping rules for <SpectrumIdentificationItem> are straightforward â
there is only one, which states âMAY supply a child term of MS:1001405_
(spectrum_identification_result_details) one or more timesâ.
CV terms to encode match level scores must therefore be children of MS:1001405
in the CVâs âis aâ hierarchy.
Those which also meet the CV mapping rules for the <Threshold> element can also
be used to encode the Threshold applied.
See Section 7.11 of the main mzIdentML document for guidance specific to PSM-
level scores for identifications based on multiple spectra.
*** 6.4.2. 4.3.2 Peptide Level Scores ***
Peptide level scores are also stored in <SpectrumIdentificationItem> elements
and everything in Â§4.3.1 also applies here.
Section 5.2.7 of the main mzIdentML specification document describes the
encoding of peptide-level scores and statistical measures. The encoding of
crosslinking results MAY also be combined with the peptide-level re-scoring
mechanism described there, but with specific CV terms for scores associated
with crosslinked peptides rather than PSM-level terms (as stated in Section
5.2.7 of main specification document).
Where needed, new CV terms for search specific scores of crosslinked peptides
should be added as a child of (i.e. with an âis aâ relationship to) the CV
term âinteraction score derived from crosslinkingâ (MS:1002664).

Figure 11. XML snippet including the encoding of scores for PSM-level matches
and peptide pairs. These are encoded inside <SpectrumIdentificationItem>
elements. âpeptide-pair passes thresholdâ (MS:1003339) would become
relevant if there was more than one score for that peptide pair (sharing the
same âpeptide group IDâ), it states whether the peptide pair passed when
all scores and thresholds are considered. This is analogous to the
passThreshold attribute of <SpectrumIdentificationItem> elements for PSM-level
scores.
*** 6.4.3. 4.3.3 Interaction Level Scores (Unique Residue-Pairs and PPI) ***
mzIdentML uses the same mechanism to encode scores for interactions at both the
unique residue-pair level and protein-protein interaction level. This encoding
was put forward in mzIdentML 1.2.0 and remains unchanged. Where a residue-pair
level score gives the position of the crosslinked residue, a protein-protein
interaction (PPI) score will instead have the value ânullâ.
mzIdentML encodes these with the same mechanism it uses to address the protein
inference problem, that is, within <ProteinAmbiguityGroup> elements. More
specifically, these scores go inside <ProteinDetectionHypothesis> elements. All
such scores must therefore meet the CV mapping rules of
<ProteinDetectionHypothesis> elements.
As the encoding of interaction scores uses <ProteinAmbiguityGroup> elements,
the guidance in Section 5.2.1 (Protein grouping encoding) of the main
specification also applies here and MUST be followed. This means that ambiguity
about which protein a crosslinked peptide came from must be reflected in how
the <ProteinDetectionHypothesis> elements containing the score are assigned to
<ProteinAmbiguityGroup> elements, see Figure 12.

*Figure 13. XML snippet showing the CV terms "protein-pair-level global FDR"
(MS:1002676) and "residue-pair-level global FDR" (MS:1002677).*

The XML snippet in Figure 13 shows the "protein-pair-level global FDR" (MS:
1002676) and "residue-pair-level global FDR" (MS:1002677) CV terms, these CV
terms have the parent CV term âinteraction score derived from crosslinkingâ
(MS:1002664). Where needed, new CV terms for search specific interaction scores
should be added as children of the CV term âinteraction score derived from
crosslinkingâ (MS:1002664).

These CV terms must have a paired structure of int_ID.a|b:POS|null:
SCORE_OR_VALUE:PASS_THRESHOLD

____
The two partners in the interaction share the same integer value for ID
followed by a or b. If there is ambiguity in protein identification, two
different ProteinDetectionHypothesis (PDH) elements, within the same
ProteinAmbiguityGroup (PAG), MAY share the same ID and suffix (a or b). A given
identifier (integer and suffix) value MUST NOT be used in more than one PAG.
____
. {blank}
+
____
The export software MAY indicate the general position of the interaction
(potentially taking on board multiple pairs of crosslinked peptides), with
respect to the protein sequence â using a 1-based counting system. A
ânullâ MAY be used if the export software does not wish to include a value.

The score or statistical value for the interaction.

âtrueâ or âfalseâ to indicate whether the score or value has passed a
reported threshold in the file. If no threshold is defined, then PASS_THRESHOLD
is always true.
____

The first âint_IDâ part of the value MUST be identical/shared between
interaction level scores if they refer to the same residue pair or PPI.

The new CV term âResidue pair refâ (MS:1003344) SHOULD be included within
<SpectrumIdentificationItem> elements to indicate that these are the spectra
which supported the linking of a specific residue pair. The value of the new
âResidue pair refâ CV term is the â_int_ID.a|b_â part of the values,
see Figure 11. More than one âResidue pair refâ (MS:1003344) CV term (with
different values) can be included in a single <SpectrumIdentificationItem>
element if it has been taken as evidence for more than one linked residue pair.

It is not a requirement that the <SpectrumIdentificationItem> elements
containing âResidue pair refâ (MS:1003344) place the linkage sites at the
same position in the peptide as the residue-pair they are claiming to support.
Hence, analyses which utilise link site reassignment can be encoded in
mzIdentML. (Some analyses may look at a collection of spectra to reach a
conclusion about where the linkage site was, therefore some identifications may
end up supporting a residue-pair that places the linkage site at a different
position from where they themselves did).

References to supporting <SpectrumIdentificationItem> elements for PPIs are
given by the <SpectrumIdentificationItemRef> elements inside
<PeptideHypothesis> elements in <ProteinDectectionHypothesis>. This performs
the equivalent role as the âResidue pair refâ (MS:1003344) CV term does for
residue-pair interactions.

See Figure 14 for an example of encoding residue-pair and PPI level scores.

Positional ambiguity of the residues linked can be encoded by repeating the
score CV terms, keeping the same identifier (integer and suffix) , for each of
the positional alternatives, see Figure 15. This may be due to ambiguity
regarding the position of the peptide in the protein sequences (protein
inference problem) or ambiguity regarding the linkage site in the peptide.

Section 7.5 of the main mzIdentML 1.3.0 specification document (âUsing decoy
databases to set different thresholds of false discovery rateâ) states that:

* {blank}
+
____
_A <SpectrumIdentificationItem> can be marked as matching a decoy peptide using
the isDecoy attribute of the referenced <PeptideEvidence> element, thus
allowing the false discovery rate to be calculated across an entire file._

_Implementers of the format SHOULD report the peptide identifications_
[including those of decoy peptides] _that pass the threshold they wish to

_It is not guaranteed that a consumer of an mzIdentML file will be able to
calculate other results, or global false discovery rates, using different
thresholds from the reported information, although in some circumstances they
may be able to, for example, if a user reports the complete output of a search
against a target and decoy search._

"crosslinked PSM-level global FDR" (MS:1003337)

A new CV term âFDR applied separately to self crosslinks and protein
heteromeric crosslinksâ (MS:1003343) has been introduced to encode whether
self crosslinks (crosslinks between peptides within one protein sequence) and
protein heteromeric crosslinks (crosslinks between distinct protein sequences)
were grouped separately for FDR analysis https://paperpile.com/c/YrD2gH/kAbLF[
[5]]. This CV term goes within the <AdditionalSearchParameters> element (see
Figure 3).

The value of âFDR applied separately to self crosslinks and protein
heteromeric crosslinksâ (MS:1003343) is a boolean, stating whether or not
this happened. This CV term SHOULD be supplied. If it is omitted then it is
unspecified whether self and heteromeric links were grouped separately for
analysis (there is no default value).

==  +

== *5. Unsupported Use Cases and Future Directions*

The two unsupported crosslinking product types shown in Figure 1 are:
crosslinkers with more than two reactive groups and higher order crosslinks
(arbitrarily many peptides identified with many crosslinks between them).

Crosslinkers with more than two reactive groups https://paperpile.com/c/YrD2gH/
8J3I[[7]] cannot be represented using the current model for two reasons. First,
the donor/acceptor mechanism for crosslinked Peptides in <SequenceCollection>
elements (Â§3.2) restricts the number of reactive groups to two. Second, there
can be at most two crosslinked <SpectrumidentificationItem> elements, each of
which references an identified peptide within a <SpectrumIdentificationResult>
(Â§3.3).

In the case of higher order crosslinks, the specification already allows the
encoding of this in the <Peptide> elements within <SequenceCollection> (or
rather nothing forbids it), see Â§3.2. It is only the restriction of there
being at most two crosslinked <SpectrumIdentificationItem> elements that share
the same value within a <SpectrumIdentificationResult> that prevents the
encoding of higher order crosslinks.

It would be possible to support higher order crosslinks by allowing _n_
crosslinked <SpectrumidentificationItem> elements within a
<SpectrumIdentificationResult>. This would pose some problems for the
validation of the documents. These would not be insurmountable because the
number of peptides that are crosslinked could be derived from <Peptide>
elements in <SequenceCollection>. However, this would make validation
significantly more complex, to alleviate this an additional CV term in peptide
that links peptides as part of a "crosslink-group" independent of the
crosslinker could be introduced. +
 +
In the case of crosslinkers with more than two reactive groups and the
identification of higher order crosslinks, there was no demand for supporting
these use cases at this point in time and so, for the sake of simplicity and
minimal changes, they are still not supported.

This remains an open question for future versions of the specification. There
are other use cases in which _n_ <SpectrumIdentificationItem> elements need to
be associated. Characterisation of antibodies or other multi-chain proteins
that contain complex patterns of disulfide bonds (representing endogenous
crosslinks) by top-down mass spectrometry would be an example of this.

== *6. Appendix I. Comparison of rules for âcrosslink donorâ and
âcrosslink acceptorâ depending on context*

The CV terms âcrosslink donorâ (MS:1002509) and âcrosslink acceptorâ
(MS:1002510) are used in two different contexts:

* {blank}
+
____
/MzIdentML/AnalysisProtocolCollection/SpectrumIdentificationProtocol/
ModificationParams/SearchModification â encoding the modifications searched
for (including specificity, see Â§3.1.2);
____
* {blank}
+
____
/MzIdentML/SequenceCollection/Peptide/Modification - encoding the modifications
of crosslinked peptides (Â§3.2).
____

Table 1 summarises the commonalities and differences between the rules
governing their use in these two contexts.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|*Element <SearchModification> (see Â§3.1.2)* |*Element <Peptide><Modification>
(see Â§3.2)*
|*Two or more* <SearchModification> elements are needed to describe the
specificity of a single crosslinker with two reactive groups. All of the donor
and acceptor CV terms contained in these *MUST* share a unique identifier in
their value slot. |A unique identifier linking these *two* Modification
elements together *MUST* be in the value slot. (Thereby excluding the
representation of trimeric crosslinkers.)
|The choice of which end is the âdonorâ and which end is the âacceptorâ
is arbitrary. |If the CV term âsearch modification id refâ (MS:1003393) is
being used then the crosslink donor *MUST* be chosen to match the end marked as
the donor in the corresponding <SearchModification> elements, see Â§3.2.2. If
that CV term is not used, or if the preceding rule does not unambiguously
define which end to mark as donor (e.g. because the crosslinker is symmetrical)
then the export software *SHOULD* use the following rules to choose the
crosslink donor as the: longer peptide, then higher peptide neutral mass, then
alphabetical order.
|The element(s) containing the crosslink donor CV term *MUST* have their mass
delta attribute = the mass gained from the crosslink reagent. |
|The element(s) containing the crosslink acceptor CV term *MUST* have their
mass delta attribute = 0. |
|*Both* crosslink donor and crosslink acceptor *MUST* have a suitably sourced
cvParam for the crosslink. |The crosslink donor peptideâs Modification
element *MUST* have a suitably sourced cvParam for the crosslink.
| |The crosslink acceptor peptideâs Modification element *MUST NOT* have a
cvParam for the reagent.

== *9. Glossary*

____
Cleavable Crosslinker - a crosslinker that can be broken in two to release the
individual peptides (in a modified form), thus enabling their individual
analysis. In crosslinking studies this typically refers to _MS-cleavable
crosslinkers_.

Controlled Vocabulary (CV) - A structured collection of terms describing a
certain Crosslink - The covalent bond formed by a _crosslinker_.

Crosslink Acceptor - one end of a crosslinking reaction, the other is the
_crosslink donor_. (Assumes the crosslinker has only two reactive groups.)

Crosslink Donor - one end of a crosslinking reaction, the other is the
_crosslink acceptor_. (Assumes the crosslinker has only two reactive groups.)

Crosslinker - A chemical reagent. A molecule which creates a covalent bond
either between proteins or within the same protein chain. This bond preserves
proximity information which would otherwise be destroyed by the enzymatic
digestion of the proteins. The proximity information is then recovered by
identifying the peptides via mass spectrometry.

Crosslinker Modified Peptide - a peptide where one reactive group of a
_crosslinker_ has reacted with one of its amino acids, but the other reactive
group has not reacted with any animo acid and no covalent bond is formed.

Crosslinker Specificity - The specificity of a crosslinker gives the amino
acids it will react with. A _crosslinker_ has reactive groups that react with
amino acids or their side-chains, the reactive groups determine the specificity
of the crosslinker.

Crosslinking Product - the result of a crosslinking reaction.

Crosslink Spectrum Match (CSM) - the subset of PSM level matches that contain a
crosslink.

Decoy (decoy databases, decoy peptide) - decoys are a set of artificially
generated sequences used to assess the performance of an identification
algorithm. Decoys are typically created by randomising or reversing the
sequences of the target proteins. These new sequences are then added to the
database used for analysis. _False Discovery Rates_ may use the identifications
of decoys to estimate the error rate in the data.

False Discovery Rate (FDR) - the fraction of identifications that are predicted
to be incorrect (false positives) among the total number of identifications
made.

Global FDR - the False Discovery Rate across the whole dataset, as opposed to
âlocal FDRâ which calculates the error rate within a given score window.

Heterobifunctional Crosslinker - a _crosslinker_ with two reactive groups in
which the reactive groups, and hence the specificity of each end, are
different.

Higher Order Crosslink - A _crosslinking product_ in which there are
arbitrarily many peptides with many crosslinks between them.

Internally Linked Peptide - A crosslinking product in which both ends of the
crosslinker have reacted within a single peptide (that is, within the same
identical peptide, not between two copies of the same peptide). This type of
crosslinking product is known to be intramolecular.

Looplink - colloquial name for an _internally linked peptide_.

Modification - a chemical change to an amino acid.

MS-Cleavable Crosslinker - a type of _cleavable crosslinker_, MS-cleavable
crosslinkers can cleave upon activation in the mass spectrometer, releasing the
individual peptides and thus enabling their individual analysis.

Noncovalently Associated Peptides - two different peptides which were not
crosslinked but stayed associated with each other throughout the workflow, due
to noncovalent interactions.

Monolink - colloquial name for a _crosslinker modified peptide_. Unimod uses
this term to describe some derivatives of crosslinkers (e.g. see http://
www.unimod.org/modifications_view.php?editid1=1842).

Open Modification Search - a search strategy which allows for any type of mass
shift to occur at any residue within a peptide sequence. In contrast to a
"closed" search, which is limited to a defined set of modifications, an open
modification search allows for the identification of novel or unexpected
modifications

Posterior Error Probability - a statistical measure of the probability that an
identification is incorrect.

Protein Heteromeric Crosslinks - crosslinks between distinct protein sequences.

Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) - an interaction between proteins. In the
context of crosslinking, it is a level of consolidation at which crosslinks may
be analysed.

PSI-MS - the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO) Proteomics Standards
Initiativeâs (PSI) controlled vocabulary for Mass Spectrometry (MS)

Peptide Spectrum Match (PSM) - a match to one or more peptides in a mass
spectrum. The lowest, unconsolidated level at which analysis of identifications
can occur. Because a single âmatchâ may identify more than one peptide, the
concept âPSMâ does not correspond directly with âspectrum identification
itemâ in mzIdentML, no element in mzIdentML does correspond directly to âa
matchâ.

PSM-level - the level of analysis that looks at individual _peptide spectrum
matches_.

Residue-pair - a unique pair of crosslinked residues, irrespective of the
peptides identified. A level of consolidation higher than unique peptide but
lower than PPI.

Self Crosslinks - crosslinks between peptides within one protein sequence.

Trimeric Crosslinker - a crosslinker with three reactive groups.
